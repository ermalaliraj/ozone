<!-- Setting antiLocking parameters to true, resolves the locking issue when undeploing on
on windows. Deployment time is increased because on every deployment a copy is created in
folder tomcat/temp (to handle the folder cleaning).
Not good approach using this configuration in PRD, because is always better
after a deployment restarting the server.-->
